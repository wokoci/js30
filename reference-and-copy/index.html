    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
const Person={
  name:'James',
  age:33,
  jobs:{
    dev:'js',
    office:'admin'
  }
};

let James = Object.assign({},Person,{name:'Samuel',age:55})

console.log(Person);
James.name='SAMUEL';
console.log(James);

console.log(Person);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
 const theOne = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(Person));
 console.log(theOne, ' --> is the one');
 theOne.jobs.office='MBBS Holder';
 console.log(theOne, ' --> is the two');
 console.log(Person,'--> remains unchanged')
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
   let player3 = [].concat(players);
   console.log(player3);
   player3[1]='Samson';
   console.log(player3);
   console.table(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
 
    // and think we make a copy:
  
 
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
